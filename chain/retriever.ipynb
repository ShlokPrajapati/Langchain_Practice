The\\ndiversity varies from the Himalayan Mountain in north to coasts in the south\\nand from Thar Desert of Rajasthan in the west to the humid forests of the North-\\nEast. Even the climatic conditions vary from the equatorial in the south to the\\npolar region in the higher slope of northern mountain. This rich diversity is bound\\nto create many natural attractions for the tourists visiting these places. The\\npeople from plain and Southern India would like to visit the Himalayan hill\\nstations in search of a cool climate during summer. Similarly, people from the\\nnorth would like to see the coastal areas. This plays a great role in providing\\nopportunities for the development of tourism in the country. Each geographical\\nregion has its own beauty. Life has become very hectic and mechanical. People\\nnow prefer to go back to nature to refresh themselves. Natural beauty is now\\nvery much in demand not only by domestic tourists but also international\\ntourists. In this lesson we shall read about India’s geographical features and\\nappreciate what it has to offer to tourists to see, enjoy and appreciate.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\\nz describe the physical features of India;\\nz explain distribution of tourist places in India;\\nz identify the natural attractions of tourist regions popular with the WildLife;\\nz describe the different Bird Sanctuaries in India and\\nz illustrate the various hill stations in India.\\n'),\n",

The Northern Mountains Regions\\n2. The Great Northern Plains\\n3. The Peninsular Plateau\\n4. The Coastal Plains and Islands.\\n12.1.1 The Northern Mountains\\nThe Northern boundary of the country is formed by the mountain system of the\\nHimalayas. It stretches from Jammu and Kashmir in the Northwest to the hill\\nranges of Purvanchal in the East. The literal meaning of the Himalaya\\n(Him+Aalay) is the abode of snow. It is one of the youngest fold mountains\\nof the world, rising to over 8000 meter above mean sea level. Being the highest\\nmountain system of the world, it also has the highest peak of the world.\\nHimalayas can be divided into mainly three parallel ranges running from West\\nto East direction:\\na. Greater Himalaya or the Himadri\\nb. Lesser Himalaya or the Himachal\\nc. Outer Himalaya or the Siwalik\\nGreater Himalaya or the Himadri: It is the northern most range with an\\naverage height of 6000 meter AMSL. Its width varies between 90 km to 120\\nkm. The greatest peak of the world, the Mt. Everest, 8848 meter (Nepal) is\\nin this range. The great peaks in Indian Territory are Kanchenjunga (8598 meter),\\nMakalu (8481 meter), Dhaulagiri (8172 meter), Manaslu (8156 meter), Nanda\\nDevi (7817 meter) etc. Many of the high mountain passes like Bara Lacha La,\\nShipkila, Thangla La, Nathula, Zojla etc. are located in this region of the\\nHimalaya. This area is also very much in demand for adventure tourism activities\\nlike rockclimbing, trekking, and watching the natural beauty of the region.\\nLesser Himalaya or the Himachal: This range runs almost parallel and to the\\nsouth of the Himadri. Its altitude varies from 1800 to 3000 meter and its width\\nis 60 to 80 km. The Dhauladhar, the Pirpanjal, Mahabharat Range and Mussoorie\\nRange are included in this section. It is a complex mosaic of forest covered by\\nranges and fertile valleys. There are many hill stations like Shimla, Kullu, Manali,\\nDharamshala, Chail, Chakrata, Mussoorie, Nainital, Almora, Ranikhet, and\\nDarjeeling besides many others in this region.'),\n",

These hill stations are very much in demand even\\ntoday, particularly in the summer season, to get respite from the scorching heat\\nof the sun in the plains and plateau region of the country.\\nOuter Himalaya or the Siwalik: They are the southern most range of the\\nmountains and are popularly known as the foothills of the Himalayas. Its altitude\\nvaries from 900 to 1500 meter and its width from 15 to 50 km. They are the\\nnewly formed ranges of the Himalayas. To the south of this range are the great\\nplains of North India. The adjoining land between plains and the mountains is\\nknown as the Terai region. It has very dense vegetation which is deciduous in\\nnature and is characterized by many long, flat-bottomed valleys known as Duns,\\nfor example Dehra Dun.'),\n",

It extends from the western boundary of the\\ncountry from Punjab and Rajasthan to the Ganges delta and the Brahmaputra\\nplain in the East. It has three main river systems namely the Indus, the Ganges\\nand the Brahmaputra. It is almost 2400 km in length from west to east. Its width\\nvaries from 200 km in Bihar to about 500 km in Punjab and Rajasthan. One\\nof the most important characteristics of the Great Northern Plains has been the\\nrise of many religions as well as being the center of civilization since time\\nimmemorial. Many of the religions, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism\\nhave evolved from this area. There are many cultural and religious centers in\\nthe plains, which have emerged as the centers of tourism for foreign as well\\nas domestic tourists. Almost the entire region is famous for various kinds of\\nattractions for tourists. These are religious places, heritage sites and historical\\nmonuments etc. about which you will read in different lessons in this course\\nof Tourism. In fact they are the driving force for growing tourism in the plains\\nof the country.\\n12.1.3 The Peninsular Plateau\\nThe Peninsula Plateau is located to the south of the Great Northern Plains. It\\nis surrounded by seas from three sides. It is one of the oldest land features of\\nworld. The Narmada river divides this peninsula into two parts. The Central\\nHighland is north of the Narmada river and the Deccan Plateau lying to the South\\nof this river.\\nThe Central Highland: It is very important for the availability of minerals and\\nfossil fuels like coal. Varieties of minerals like iron-ore, bauxite, copper,\\nmanganese, lead, zinc, coal, mica, nickel etc. are found in abundance. These\\nminerals are the backbone for industrial development. Many of them are very\\nessential for the development of infrastructures. The area offers great employment\\nopportunity to the people as well as tourism.\\nThe Deccan Plateau:  It covers an area of about 7 lakh sq. km. Its Northern\\nboundary is along the Satpura Range, Mahadev Hills and Rajmahal Hills.\\nTogether they form the base of the triangular shape of the Deccan Plateau. Its\\ntwo sides run along the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats and converge at the\\nsouthern tip of the Peninsula. It stretches over Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,\\nKarnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Many of the east flowing\\nrivers originate from the Western Ghats and drain downwards to the east because\\nit slopes towards the eastern side. The Plateau can be divided into three distinct'),\n",

The hill-\\nstations and heritage sites are in good demand for tourists. There are many\\ntunnels in the way. They provide beautiful picturesque scenic beauty with\\nnumerous waterfalls. They provide connectivity through road and railways. They\\nplay an important role in promoting tourism by reducing the time, distance and\\nmoney of the tourists.\\nThe Eastern Ghats are a discontinuous mountain range along the eastern coast\\nof India. The Nimaigiri hills of Koraput and Mahendragiri hills of Ganjam\\ndistricts of Odisha attain a height of about 1500 meter. These hills are thickly\\nforested. Udagamandalam (Ooty), situated in Nilgiri Hills, is a very favoured\\nhill station of South India. The southern parts of these broken ranges are lower\\nin height. The southern part of this culminates in the form of a tip, joining both\\nthe Ghats – Western and Eastern.\\n12.1.4 The Coastal Plains and Islands\\nThe Coastal Plains of India are found on both coasts – eastern and western.\\nWestern Coastal Plain is confined between the Western Ghats and the Arabian\\nSea. It starts from the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat in the North to Kanyakumari\\nin the South. Several cascading waterfalls may be observed which attract tourists\\nfrom various regions. This plain is simply divided into three.\\nThe northern plain is known as Konkan Plain, the middle one as Kannad Plain\\nand the southernmost as Malabar Plain. There are a number of long and narrow\\nlagoons and backwaters e.g. V embanad which is very famous in Kerala.\\nThe Eastern Coastal Plains are located between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay\\nof Bengal, starting from the southern part of the Gangatic Delta to Kanyakumari.\\nNear Kanyakumari both plains – Eastern and Western meet and converge into\\none. This plain is about 120 km wide. These plains are very rich in soil fertility,\\nproducing abundance of rice. There are many rivers draining through this plain\\ncreating delta at their mouths.

Therefore, tourist centers are distributed throughout the country. These\\nattractions are very closely associated with certain types of physiographic\\nregions of the country. For examples, hill-stations are on the hills and mountains\\nwhich offer cool climatic conditions. The mountainous region offers adventure\\ntourism such as rock climbing, trekking angling, parachuting, rafting etc.\\nHimalayan rivers provide the base for white water rafting in the Ganga, the\\nAlaknanda, Chenab, the Beas etc. The beaches are found along the sea coasts.\\nThe combination of sea, sand and sun is very attractive for tourists such as\\nKovalam the world famous beach in Kerala.

They are\\ncool even in the summer season. This is because of the height. With increasing\\nheight of 165 meter, temperature decreases by 1°C. It happens because the air\\nis sparse at higher altitude. Sun’s radiation reaches the surface first. Land surface\\nis warmed up and the surface radiates the heat in the form of long waves. Thus,\\nthe air is warmed up. Since the air is less dense and sparse, the effectiveness\\nof the sun’s heat is less.
